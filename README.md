# ebs-ui-scripts
A few useful shell scripts to make everyone's (EBS Front End) life easier. These are examples of the scripts that I run on my local to swap between the TUI package dependencies on my local.  You'll probably want to fork this repo and then change the file paths to wherever the respective projects are located on your local.

## Setup
1. Clone/fork this repo.
2. `cd ebs-ui-scripts` into the repo on your local
3. Open each file, in the editor of your choice, and adjust the project paths to suit your machine (I'm planning on making this better)
4. `chmod 700 <filename>` on each file to make it executable
5. Run the link/unlink file that you need eg. `./link-portal-to-tui`

**Note:** I'll eventually make these piles take path args so you can build your own scripts on top if these scripts are found to be useful.
